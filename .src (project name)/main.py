# All python files go in src folder

# main - is required. This is where the project is run from!
    # Basically nothing on this page, it is just used to call other pages with functions that run the program
    # Basic UI allowed on this page BUT it is better to have it on a seperate file

# only import onto main if at all possible. Do not import multiple files onto your other pages!
